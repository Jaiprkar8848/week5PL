ifstream -> input file stream -> class 
provide facility to create input from some to some file
it creates an object associated with given file

is_open-> checking whether file is opened or not
or we can say ki file is in our instance or not

getline-> taking string from line to line

close-> closing the file when work done


p_thread is an api that  for all thread related functions

pthread_create is a function used to create new thread
4 attributes -> 
thread-> pointer to pthread_t var where system can store id of new thread
attr->pointer to a thread attributes object that define thread properties(default use null)
routine-> pointer to func that thread will exec (return void* and accept void*)
arg-> a single argument passed to thread func. Use null if no argument is needed. We can pass a struct or pointer to pass multiple values


Shared data is defined outside any function(global scope).
All threads can access and modify it

pthread_mutex_t is a data type provided by the POSIX Threads (pthreads) library used to implement mutexes (mutual exclusions). A mutex is a synchronization primitive used to protect shared resources (like a shared index or data structure) from concurrent access by multiple threads.
pthread_mutex_init-> 2args pointer to mutex var and pointer to mutex attributes
pthread_mutex_lock-> pointer to the mutex to pthread_mutex_lock, it blocks the calling thread until mutex is available and locks it
pthread_mutex_unlock-> release mutex lock that calling thread previously acquired
pthread_join-> it blocks thread until target thread has terminated
pthread_self-> return id of calling thread
pthread_mutex_destroy-> destroy mutex and releases any system resource it used
